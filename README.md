# FilmQueryProject

## Description:
This applications is to allow a user to gain appropriate information from the data based
via using a java through the JDBC to mysql. Which the user will be accessing information from the film data base.



## Technologies:

- JDBC - Java Database Connectivity.
- mysql - RDMS relational database management system.
- Maven -  is a software project management and comprehension tool. control the dependencies.


## What I Learned
I have learned that the JDBC allows java code to be translated into mysql and vice versa. Knowing what part is wrong with the code and missing the concept can cost more time than needed and time is money. The need to continue to learn the tools we use is always important. Code is more often read than written. I continue to read code from others to see how they handle a situation or going in to the documents to see what syntax I may have made mistakes with. The worst is when syntax is fine and the logic is broken.

> That code is more often read than written.
